            <p>Studying Computer Science in college has taught me an important
                lesson that continues to be my approach to every challenge; 
                start with building a solid base. My base is knowing how to
                learn and dissect every issue until I understand it completely.
                I made this the foundation for all of my skills. What I find 
                most attractive about Computer Science is the possibility to 
                not only work with new and advanced technologies but to also 
                improve and create exciting projects. This is also the reason 
                for my passion and why I welcome any opportunities to learn. 
                As for my dreams and ambitions, my long-term goal is to become
                a full stack developer, a position which will enable me to have
                the status of a full-rounded software engineer. My desire for 
                the immediate future, however, is to work in a rookie friendly
                environment and build my career layer by layer.</p>
