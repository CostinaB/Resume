        "description": "Studying Computer Science has taught me an important lesson that continues to be my approach to every challenge; start with building a solid foundation. For me, this is analyzing every issue until I understand it completely and feel confident using it. One of the reasons for my passion and why I welcome any opportunity to learn is the possibility to improve the technology and come up with creative solutions for exciting projects. As for my dreams and ambitions, my long-term goal is to become a full stack developer. My desire for the immediate future, however, is to work in a rookie friendly environment and build my career layer by layer."
